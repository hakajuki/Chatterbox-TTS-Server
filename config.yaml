  last_text: 'The rain hammered the city like it had a personal vendetta. I sat in
    my office, the only light coming from a flickering neon sign outside that spelled
    out "VACANCY" in letters as broken as most of my clients'' dreams. She walked
    in at midnight, the kind of dame that made trouble look like a vacation destination.
    Said her husband was missing. I knew right then this case would end with either
    handcuffs or heartbreak. In this town, you learn not to tell the difference. I
    took a long drag from my cigarette and watched the smoke curl up toward a ceiling
    that had heard too many confessions. The night was young, but in this business,
    everything ages fast.
